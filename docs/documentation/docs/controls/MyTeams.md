## How to use this control in your solutions

- Check that you installed the `@pnp/spfx-controls-react` dependency. Check out the [getting started](../../#getting-started) page for more information about installing the dependency.
- Import the control into your component:

```TypeScript
import { MyTeams } from "@pnp/spfx-controls-react/lib/MyTeams";
```

- Use the `MyTeams` control in your code as follows:

```TypeScript
 <MyTeams
            title="My Teams"
            webPartContext={context}
            themeVariant={themeVariant}/>
```

```TypeScript
  <MyTeams
            title="My Teams"
            webPartContext={context}
            themeVariant={themeVariant}
            enablePersonCardInteraction={true}
            onSelectedChannel={onSelectedChannel}
          />
```


- The `onSelectedChannel` callback returns the teamId and ChannelId and can be implemented as follows:

```TypeScript
 const  onSelectedChannel = (teamsId: string, channelId: string) => {
        console.log("TeamsId", teamsId);
        console.log("ChannelId", channelId);
  };
```
